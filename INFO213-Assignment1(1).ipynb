    "### D. When to Hand In\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit your assignment no later than 11:59pm in the due date.\n",
    "2. There will be a 10% (absolute value) deduction for each day of lateness, to a maximum of 3 days; assignments will not be accepted beyond that point. Missing work will earn a zero grade.\n",

    "### E. Written Presentation Requirements (if applicable)\n",
    "Images must be clear and legible. Assignments will be judged on the basis of visual appearance, grammatical correctness, and quality of writing, as well as their contents. Please make sure that the text of your assignments is well-structured, using paragraphs, full sentences, and other features of well-written presentation.\n",

    "### F. Marking Schemes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Marking assignments will be based on several aspects: presentation, correctness and coding styles. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a good comment for each variable, each method, each control branch, and each loop. \n",
    "2. Your method comments must mention the purpose of each parameter, and must be grammatically correct.  \n",
