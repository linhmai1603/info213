    "Naive Bayes classifiers are built on Bayesian classification methods.\n",

    "In Bayesian classification, we're interested in finding the probability of a label given some observed features, which we can write as $P(L~|~{\\rm features})$.\n",
    "Bayes's theorem tells us how to express this in terms of quantities we can compute more directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\\frac{P(L_1~|~{\\rm features})}{P(L_2~|~{\\rm features})} = \\frac{P({\\rm features}~|~L_1)}{P({\\rm features}~|~L_2)}\\frac{P(L_1)}{P(L_2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "All we need now is some model by which we can compute $P({\\rm features}~|~L_i)$ for each label.\n",
    "Such a model is called a *generative model* because it specifies the hypothetical random process that generates the data.\n",
    "Specifying this generative model for each label is the main piece of the training of such a Bayesian classifier.\n",
    "The general version of such a training step is a very difficult task, but we can make it simpler through the use of some simplifying assumptions about the form of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the \"naive\" in \"naive Bayes\" comes in: if we make very naive assumptions about the generative model for each label, we can find a rough approximation of the generative model for each class, and then proceed with the Bayesian classification.\n",

    "These advantages mean a naive Bayesian classifier is often a good choice as an initial baseline classification.\n",
    "If it performs suitably, then congratulations: you have a very fast, very interpretable classifier for your problem.\n",
    "If it does not perform well, then you can begin exploring more sophisticated models, with some baseline knowledge of how well they should perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers tend to perform especially well in one of the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the naive assumptions actually match the data (very rare in practice)\n",
    "- For very well-separated categories, when model complexity is less important\n",
    "- For very high-dimensional data, when model complexity is less important\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two points seem distinct, but they actually are related: as the dimension of a dataset grows, it is much less likely for any two points to be found close together (after all, they must be close in *every single dimension* to be close overall).\n",
    "This means that clusters in high dimensions tend to be more separated, on average, than clusters in low dimensions, assuming the new dimensions actually add information.\n",
    "For this reason, simplistic classifiers like naive Bayes tend to work as well or better than more complicated classifiers as the dimensionality grows: once you have enough data, even a simple model can be very powerful."
