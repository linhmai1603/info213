Komen Foundation, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed of invasive breast cancer. The dataset offers the opportunity to classify whether or not someone has breast cancer based on 9 true features. The objective for this project is to identify the best K-Nearest Neighbor approach to identify breast cancer with the best accuracy. Hopefully, the results of this projects can be of use to others. \n",
